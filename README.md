Jupyter notebooks on synchrotron radiation and radio transients
Containing tutorials and code snippets for understanding your results


**Basics** notebook requires the image files ss.png and slab.png 
This notebook may be all you need if you want the most basic understanding of synchrotron emission and how the first models
(e.g. van der Laan) are calculated

**Equipartition analysis** provides the full derivation of the equipartition argument, with a more precise formula than the approximation provided in *Basics*

Many thanks to Miriam Nyamai, Joe Bright, Lauren Rhodes and Sara Motta for test-driving and minor edits. Additional test-drivers very welcome.
